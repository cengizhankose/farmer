# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Stacks-focused Yield Farming Aggregator** being developed for a 5-day hackathon, with plans to expand to multichain support (Ethereum, Solana) in later phases. The project aims to aggregate DeFi yield farming opportunities, provide normalized APR/APY data with risk scoring, and enable single-click deposits through a non-custodial router contract.

### Key Data Types (Current Implementation)
```typescript
export type ChainId = "stacks" | "ethereum" | "solana";

export type Opportunity = {
  id: string;
  protocol: string;
  pair: string; // e.g., "STX/USDA"
  chain: ChainId;
  apr: number;
  apy: number;
  risk: "Low" | "Medium" | "High";
  tvlUsd: number;
  rewardToken: string;
  lastUpdated: string; // e.g., "5m", "1h"
  originalUrl: string;
  summary: string;
};

// Adapter interface (implemented in lib/adapters/)
interface Adapter {
  fetchOpportunities(): Promise<Opportunity[]>;
}
```

## Development Phases

### Phase A (Current MVP - Hackathon) âœ… IN PROGRESS
- âœ… Next.js app with TypeScript setup
- âœ… Stacks-focused opportunity discovery UI
- âœ… ALEX and Arkadiko protocol adapters (mock implementation)
- âœ… Multichain preview with disabled Ethereum/Solana cards
- âœ… Basic routing: home, opportunities list, individual opportunity details, portfolio
- âœ… Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- âœ… Wallet context setup (for future integration)
- ðŸš§ Router contract with security features (allowlist, pausable, reentrancy guard, per-tx cap)
- ðŸš§ Live wallet integration (Leather/Hiro)
- ðŸš§ Portfolio dashboard with real transaction tracking

### Phase B (Post-hackathon)
- Single-click deposits through router contract
- Hybrid data strategy (API + lightweight indexer)
- Enhanced UX with gas estimates and net yield calculations

### Phase C (Long-term)
- Vault structures with auto-compounding
- Performance fees and advanced monetization
- Pro features (alerts, rebalancing, advanced risk scoring)
- Full multichain support

## Security Requirements

### Smart Contract Level
- **Allowlist**: Only approved protocol addresses
- **Pausable**: Emergency stop functionality
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevent reentrancy attacks
- **Per-tx cap**: Maximum transaction limits
- **MinOut/SlippageGuard**: Slippage protection
- **Event logging**: Comprehensive event emissions

### Frontend Level
- **ChainId validation**: Ensure correct network
- **Read-only fallback**: Graceful degradation when wallet unavailable
- **Data transparency**: Source and lastUpdated timestamps
- **Risk labeling**: Clear risk indicators with "BETA - not financial advice" disclaimers

## Core Features

1. **Next.js + TypeScript**: Modern React framework with full type safety
2. **Opportunity Discovery**: Normalized APR/APY display with risk scoring
3. **Protocol Adapters**: Modular adapter system for ALEX, Arkadiko (extensible)
4. **Responsive UI**: Tailwind CSS with custom components and mobile-first design
5. **Wallet Integration**: Context setup for Leather/Hiro wallet support (Stacks)
6. **Single-Click Deposits**: Router contract for streamlined UX (planned)
7. **Portfolio Management**: Track investments and estimated returns (in progress)
8. **Multichain Preview**: Preview cards for Ethereum/Solana (disabled)

## Data Strategy

- **Current**: Mock data with realistic Stacks opportunities (ALEX, Arkadiko) + preview data for multichain
- **Near-term**: Direct protocol API/SDK integration for real-time data
- **Future**: Hybrid model with lightweight indexer for sanity checks
- **Risk Scoring**: Simple rule-based system (stablecoin pairs = Low, new/volatile pools = High)

## Monetization Strategy

- **Router fees**: 0.5-1% on deposits
- **Performance fees**: 10-15% on vault strategies (Phase C)
- **Pro subscription**: Advanced features and alerts (Phase C)

## Testing Requirements

### Smart Contract Tests
- Allowlist enforcement (reject non-approved protocols)
- Pause functionality during emergencies
- MinOut validation and slippage protection
- Per-transaction cap enforcement
- Event emission verification
- Reentrancy protection

### Frontend Tests
- Next.js page routing and navigation
- TypeScript type safety and compilation
- Opportunity data display and filtering
- Responsive component behavior
- Mock data integration
- Wallet connection flows (when implemented)
- Portfolio calculations (when implemented)
- Error handling for failed transactions

## Demo Flow (Current Implementation)

1. **Home Page**: Overview with stats and quick navigation
2. **Browse Opportunities**: View Stacks opportunities (ALEX, Arkadiko) with normalized APR/APY and risk labels
3. **Opportunity Details**: Click individual opportunities to see detailed breakdown and summary
4. **Multichain Preview**: View disabled Ethereum and Solana cards showcasing future support
5. **Portfolio Page**: Mock portfolio dashboard layout (ready for wallet integration)
6. **Responsive Design**: Test mobile and desktop layouts

### Planned Demo Flow (Next Steps)
7. **Connect Wallet**: Leather/Hiro wallet integration
8. **Execute Deposits**: Through router contract (testnet)
9. **Live Portfolio**: Real transaction tracking and returns calculation

## Important Notes

- **Current Status**: Next.js + TypeScript MVP with mock data and responsive UI
- **Hackathon Focus**: Rapid iteration and feature development for demo
- **Stacks Ecosystem**: Initially targeting ALEX, Arkadiko protocols
- **Security Priority**: Implement all safety measures before mainnet deployment
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for robust development
- **UI Transparency**: Emphasize data sources, last updated times, and risk disclaimers
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular adapter system for easy protocol integration
